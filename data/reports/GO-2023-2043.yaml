summary: Improper handling of special tags within script contexts in html/template
description: |-
    The html/template package does not apply the proper rules for handling
    occurrences of "<script", "<!--", and "</script" within JS literals in <script>
    contexts. This may cause the template parser to improperly consider script
    contexts to be terminated early, causing actions to be improperly escaped. This
    could be leveraged to perform an XSS attack.
