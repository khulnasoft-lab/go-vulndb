summary: Memory exhaustion in QUIC connection handling in crypto/tls
description: |-
    QUIC connections do not set an upper bound on the amount of data buffered when
    reading post-handshake messages, allowing a malicious QUIC connection to cause
    unbounded memory growth.

    With fix, connections now consistently reject messages larger than 65KiB in
    size.
