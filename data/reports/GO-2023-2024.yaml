summary: libp2p nodes vulnerable to OOM attack
description: |-
    A malicious actor can store an arbitrary amount of data in the memory of a
    remote node by sending the node a message with a signed peer record. Signed peer
    records from randomly generated peers can be sent by a malicious actor. This
    memory does not get garbage collected and so the remote node can run out of
    memory (OOM).
